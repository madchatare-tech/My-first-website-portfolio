# My First Website – Portfolio

This is my first learning project in web development.  
I built this website using **HTML and CSS only**, with the help of AI tools, to understand how websites are structured and styled.

The goal of this project is **learning by building**, keeping everything clean, minimal, and beginner-friendly.
